# 🏦 Bank Attribution Analysis

## 📘 Project Overview
The **Bank Attribution Analysis** project focuses on understanding the underlying factors that influence **bank performance, customer engagement, and key financial metrics** through data-driven analysis.

Using banking or customer datasets, the goal is to identify:
- Which attributes contribute most to customer satisfaction or churn  
- Trends in account activity or demographics  
- Data quality issues such as missing or inconsistent records  

This project helps banks make informed decisions in **customer segmentation**, **targeted marketing**, and **service optimization**.

## 🎯 Objectives
1. **Explore and Clean the Dataset**
   - Load and inspect the dataset.
   - Identify and handle missing, duplicate, or inconsistent values.

2. **Analyze Key Banking Attributes**
   - Understand relationships between customer and transactional features.
   - Identify attributes that may drive key outcomes like retention or revenue.

3. **Visualize Insights**
   - Create visualizations to communicate findings and trends.

4. **Prepare for Predictive Modeling**
   - The cleaned dataset can later be used for building predictive models such as churn prediction or customer value estimation.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries
The analysis was performed in a **Jupyter Notebook** using:
- **Python**
- **pandas** – data manipulation and analysis  
- **numpy** – numerical operations  
- **matplotlib** – data visualization  
- **seaborn** – advanced visualization and styling

## 📊 Methodology

### 1. Data Loading
- Imported the dataset using pandas.  
- Explored columns, data types, and summary statistics.  

### 2. Data Cleaning
- Managed missing values and removed duplicates.  
- Converted data types where necessary for consistency.  

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Studied feature distributions using histograms and count plots.  
- Visualized relationships between customer attributes and key variables.  

### 4. Visualization & Insights
- Created heatmaps and correlation plots to identify strong feature relationships.  
- Highlighted trends in customer demographics, account activity, and banking behavior.

## 📈 Key Insights
- Several attributes were found to be strongly correlated with account type and customer engagement.  
- Data cleaning improved dataset consistency by handling missing and duplicate entries.  
- Visual analysis revealed patterns that can be used to enhance customer targeting and service strategies.  

These insights provide a **foundation for future predictive modeling** and strategic decision-making.
